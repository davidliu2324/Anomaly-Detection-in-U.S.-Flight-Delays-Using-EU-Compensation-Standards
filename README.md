# Abstract
This study evaluates the potential application of the European Unionâ€™s Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 to U.S. domestic flights by detecting anomalies in delay patterns, routes, and airports. Using January 2019 U.S. flight data enriched with precipitation, distance, and compensation eligibility variables, multiple anomaly detection methods such as Interquartile Range (IQR) analysis, Mahalanobis distance, DBSCAN clustering, and distance-based outlier detection were applied. Results show that only 2.4% of flights would qualify for compensation under EU rules, with impacts concentrated on specific hubs, notably Chicago, San Francisco, and Boston, and certain high-delay routes. Departure and arrival delays exhibited a near-perfect correlation (r = 0.96), indicating that delays are rarely recovered in flight, supporting the use of departure delays as the primary compensation metric. Precipitation had limited predictive power, suggesting that operational and logistical factors play a larger role. Most routes were delay-symmetric, though a minority showed significant directional asymmetry, reinforcing the case for route-specific policy adjustments. Findings indicate that an EU-style compensation system could be implemented in the U.S. in a targeted and data-driven manner to improve passenger rights while minimizing undue burden on airlines.
